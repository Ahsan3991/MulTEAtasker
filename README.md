MulTEAtasker is a flappy bird style game written by me in Python using Pygame library. In this game you play as a character who is a corporate employee and he has to finish tasks in order to get salary increments.
Every second the employee loses its power and therefore he has to drink chai (Tea) in order to replenish its power. 
After downloading the files make sure you have updated python installed including Pygame and then go to the folder where you have downloaded the files and open terminal from there, after that you can run the 
game by typing "python3 fun.py"

THINGS TO ADD
Different levels to achieve promotion
Better algorithm to decrease power level and to increase it by drinking tea
Adding time stamp to make sure the employee achieve the required number of tasks in that level within the stipulated time
