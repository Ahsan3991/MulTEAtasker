MulTEAtasker is a flappy bird style game written by me in Python using Pygame library. In this game you play as a character who is a corporate employee 
and he has to finish tasks in order to get salary increments. Every second the employee loses his power and therefore he has to drink chai (Tea) in order to replenish his power. 
Game images are designed by me using kolourpaint in Ubuntu. 

How to run the game on Ubuntu (tested on Noble Numbat)
1) Download all the files on your local folder
2) Make sure to install the updated version of Python and Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu?parent=)
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install python3.6
    ```
4) Open the terminal and goto the folder where the game files reside
5) Then type Python3 fun.py and press enter

THINGS TO ADD
1) Different levels to achieve promotion
2) Better algorithm to decrease power level and to increase it by drinking tea
3) Adding time stamp to make sure the employee achieve the required number of tasks in that level within the stipulated time
4) Sounds for every hit and Game over
5) Better background
